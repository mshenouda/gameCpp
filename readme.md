#Game demonstrates basic understanding of object oriented concepts<br/>
brute force algorithms, stream input and output, string matching, debugging and Makefiles.
#Rules are mentioned on the intro of the game.<br/>
#Machine pattern is written as a hint for bored players but faded with strikethrough. Don't look at the pattern unless you have to !!. <br/>
#Only A,B,C are allowed case insensitive as a valid input.<br/>
#X case insensitive to exit the game.<br/>
#Run Makefile<br/>
    to build: make<br/>
    to clean object files and old builds: make clean<br/>
    to run bin file ./main.out <br/>
